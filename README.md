## Personalized AI-Driven Intervention Engine

1. **Dynamic Risk Assessment**  
   - ML algorithms analyze combined profile data to identify high-risk periods and vulnerability markers  
   - Pattern recognition highlights triggers (e.g., sleep deficit + work stress + isolation)  

2. **Contextualized Exercise Matching**  
   - Selects coping strategies aligned with physical state, trauma context, and user preferences  
   - Customizes exercise duration, visual design, and delivery timing  

3. **Adaptive Feedback Loop**  
   - Collects user feedback on each intervention’s effectiveness  
   - Continuously refines recommendations, learning from engagement and outcome data  

4. **Crisis Recognition & Safety Protocols**  
   - Detects high-risk language patterns and flags for immediate resource provision  
   - Integrates emergency contacts and hotline links when necessary
