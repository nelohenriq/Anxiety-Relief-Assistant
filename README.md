-   **Granular Consent**: You control how your data is used with three distinct consent levels:
    -   **Essential**: No personalization.
    -   **Enhanced**: Personalization based on non-sensitive lifestyle data.
    -   **Complete**: Full personalization using all profile data you provide.

-   **Flexible AI Providers**: Choose between the powerful cloud-based Google Gemini model or a self-hosted local model via Ollama for complete offline privacy.
-   **Data Management**: Easily clear all your data from the device at any time or download an anonymous log of your interactions.
-   **Light & Dark Mode**: An adaptive interface for your comfort.
-   **Offline First (PWA)**: As a Progressive Web App, Serene works offline, ensuring you always have access to your tools.

### 4. Safety & History
-   **Crisis Support**: A dedicated, always-visible button provides immediate access to localized crisis hotlines based on your language settings. This is also triggered by keywords related to self-harm.
-   **Comprehensive History**: Review your past generated plans, completed exercises (with your ratings), and saved thought records.
-   **Global Search**: Quickly find exercises, journal entries, or tools across the entire application.
